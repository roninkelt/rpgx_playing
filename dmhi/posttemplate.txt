Dai meets the bunch with the beginnings of a smile on his face, but when he sees how beat up everyone is, turns immediately serious.

[say]Etoile is the french language word for star. It can refer to a number of different things - in many cases it is applied to communes for some cultural reason. It's also the name of an alternate computer environment. There are several locations named Etoile scattered around the world. Possibly the most prominent is as the highest rank of dancer in the Paris Ballet.[/say]

He ponders for a moment before continuing [say]there is also the film Etoile starring Jennifer Connolly from 1989, but that seems unlikely in this context, I mention it strictly for completeness.[/say]

As Dorian seems to be in charge,  Dai wants to make himself useful. [say]Would it be alright if I open the cooler? Precautions?[/say]

[fieldset="ooc"] I really hope that the box doesn't contain what it did in your reference Spats.

Assuming that Dai has been here for at least a bit, is there a clean room or isolation chamber with negative pressure available?
