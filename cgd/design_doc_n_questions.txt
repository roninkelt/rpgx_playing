use dice to randomize results or some other method?

Are players and GM equally subject to the results of randomization?

Should randomization be limited to questions in which there is some dramatic conflict or does randomization happen for any action?

why would a character choose to be broadly competent rather than specializing and building a pool of 10 or 15 dice in one or two skills?

how can a game encourage a well rounded character rather than a one trick pony?

how to optimize for pbp?
PBP problem areas:
  speed of commo
  
PBP strengths:
  depth of commo

suggested solutions:
  player narrated results/assertion of facts
  less negotiation

How to not rely on waiting for dice interpretation
  pre-set conditions of success
  
[B]Unopposed Test[/B]
test a pool of dice against a fixed difficulty obstacle. 

If a character is strictly using Aptitudes and has no Application dice to add, then the difficulty doubles.

[B]Opposed Test[/B]
Made when active opposition is involved in a Test. Opposing pools do not have to be composed similarly. Physical/Stealth - Wilderness vs Personal/Notice - Alertness is absolutely likely.  The Test Difficulty is modified by the number of dice in the opposition's pool by a factor of 3 dice to +1 Test Difficulty.

[B]Consumed Pool Test[/B]
Made when it is desirable to extend the roleplay time for a test. Alternately used when a task may be accomplished only with an extended investment of time, in which case each roll of the pool represents a certain amount of time.

the number of dice in an opponents pool modify the number of successes required. So an opponent with 5 dice in the pool would add 2 to the normal number of successes (this simulates a 50% success rate).

**Example Test Difficulties**
Difficulties are for for a character who performs the task on a regular basis. Picking a tumbler lock may be an expert task for the average person, but is routine for a character with skill in the task.

Characters are built from Aptitudes and Applications.

During character creation:

Buying an Aptitude costs 2 points per die

Buying an Application Trunk costs 2 points per die

Buying an application Branch costs 1 point per die

After Character Creation:

raising an Aptitude or Application Trunk costs 2 times the level of to be bought - buying from 2 to 3 would cost 6.

raising an Application Branch would cost the level to be bought - raising a branch from 2 to 3 would cost 3.

skill level n cost n+1 to advance for branch skills and 2(n+1) for trunk skills and attributes

pool is rolled and any dice which are 6 or greater are deemed successes. The number of successes is compared to the Obstacle of the Test.

Successes which are also the dice\'s maximum value are rolled again. This continues as long as a die rolls it\'s maximum value, being said to explode.

Degree of Success is the number of successes over the obstacle of the test.
If the Degree is Zero, the test Succeeds, but a complication may be introduced.



#Character Motives

All characters possess four Motive Attributes, each defining some touchstone for the character's current circumstance.

Motives give your character the will, drive, and determination to accomplish and succeed when they are pursuing them, driving the narrative and the going gets tough. As such they should be powerful and clear, with a call to action inherent as well as some sort of dramatic conflict.

Motives may also be rewritten and reconsidered or cast in a new light as the game continues. They are not meant to remain static. They are intended to grow and change - to be strengthened, weakened, resolved or broken. All things which are rewarded. 


##Defining Motives

Types of motives

1. Goals

An easy Motive to write is a goal. Usually this works if there is a concrete situation, a defined tension, that is known to exist during character creation. You know about a key of the game in advance and can integrate that into your character build.

Goal-based Motives can produce two very different kinds of conflicts. The simplest is raw challenge - the GM presents challenges to be overcome on the way to achieving the goal. The second conflict is one of internal choices: just how far are you willing to go and what will you sacrifice in pursuit of the goal - ideals, relationships, other goals?

2. Relationships

Relationships as Motives are a great source of tension. At the simplest, a relationship can be threatened by cutting off characters from contact - imprisonment, kidnapping, or death. Alternately and sometimes more significantly, a relationship is threatened by loss of trust, resentment, misunderstanding, and more.

If the relationship is a negative one from the start, then the tension can come from how you deal with it in spite of social pressure that makes it something you can't simply walk away from or end without a lot of trouble.

Relationships as Motives can mean conflicts of having bad things happen to the people you care about, struggling to maintain the good will, or else having ties to bad people.

Relationship Motives should have an element of tension to them. Something that motivates the character to take action. 

3. Ideals

Ideals are principles, beliefs, oaths, codes of conduct or values the character holds dear. There should be some conflict between the demands of this type of belief and the other beliefs that the character holds, forcing the character to make hard choices.

4. Self Doubt or Fear

Self doubt is a great Motive tool and point for character development. It may have multiple layers of meaning - a Motive about what your character fears (correctly or incorrectly) and/or a Motive about what the character subconsciously acts on, but hasn't consciously acknowledged yet.

5. Destiny

The character may or may not be aware that they have some sort of destiny about them, something toward which their whole life is building.

##Using Motives

Motives are a player's way of letting everyone know what it is that they want the game to be about so be sure that's actually what you want the game to be about.

If you write something that doesn't motivate you, then the game is likely not going to be in your interest. Likewise, also realize that Motives you choose are where conflict will happen and that the outcome is in doubt. Should there be an aspect of your character that is not in doubt, don't make it a Motive. 

In addition motives are the method of advancing your character. By doing things that they care about, you gain points to spend on increasing Applications and Aptitudes. That will be discussed more in [Running the Game](Running the Game/index.html).

##Adjusting Motives

As players get a better handle of their characters and their place within the world they will want to adjust and change Motives. Initial Motives that you thought were going to be interesting, turn out to not have been once you start playing and you figure out what is actually interesting. Some Motives may get wording adjusted, refining conflicts you want to see. Others may get replaced with something altogether different and more interesting. 

This process is important as it helps redirect play to what is most interesting for the group as a whole.

In addition Motives may be replaced as they are satisfied or fulfilled. When a character achieves a goal, fulfills an oath or in any other way renders a Motive irrelevant or otherwise uninteresting, the player must spend the points attached to that Motive then rewrite to suit.

##Motives as a tool for character growth

Consider the option taking Motives that are simple minded or just plain wrong, with the purpose of making a narrative arc of your character growing beyond them.

##Contrasting characters with Motives

it may be self evident, but two otherwise identical characters can have a completely different feel based on Motive.
