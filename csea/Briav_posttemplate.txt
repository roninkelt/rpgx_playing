Sooner better than later - his father had taunted him with those very words on the way out after his last visit home. The returning punch he had landed lifted the old man from his feet but didn't remove the sting of the words. The implication that it would never happen still stung and put him in a foul mood at times. Briav's teeth ground and jaw muscles jumped at the memory.
