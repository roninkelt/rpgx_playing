[secret="trinity, hack"]Dow hunts through the comm gear to focus and punch the signal thru. His hands and eyes sweep the controls, making minute adjustments setting all the antennae and dishes to converge on the same azimuth increasing power concentration. With a final touch of his own he adds a bit of modulation that will perhaps allow the side lobe radiation to break thru on an unexpected frequency if the main signal does not.  

He peeks into the hallway and seeing the lasers and sonar pings, rips a fire extinguisher off the wall and blasts the contents into the hallway toward the main corridor. The white noise of discharge should block sonar and the white haze attenuate the laser beams accuracy and range. Taping the handle partway open he lets the thing discharge and returns his full attention to the comm room.
