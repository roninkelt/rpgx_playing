Dow looks tired. It's been a long couple of weeks - chased, shot at,
hiding and now marooned. He shakes his head and continues toward the ship.

[say]Won't find out fer sure til we ask. Maybe they even have something to eat other than lifeboat protein packs.[/say]

When they get closer - maybe 50 yards or so, Dow is careful to keep his
hands out of his pockets and waves at the ship. The whole time, it's
looking tantalizingly familiar but the angle of approach is hiding the tail markings.

[say]Let's be careful here Jakes. I don't fancy gettin shot nor left for
dead.[/say]

Then he waves both hands and shouts - 

[say]Hola! Ahoy the ship! We don't mean no trouble.[/say]
